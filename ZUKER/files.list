      Suboptimal RNA folding package - M. Zuker, J. A. Jaeger, D. H. Turner

                             Version 2.0

Makefile - Standard UNIX makefile for RNA folding programs.

alu.ct - A concatenation of 15 ct files containing part of the output 
         produced by executing lrna using bat2.com as input.
         ( lrna  <bat2.com   ) These are 15 foldings of an ALU 
         sequence. The first is optimal.

alu.distance - The output of the 'distance' program using alu.ct as 
               input. This file contains all the pairwise distances 
               between 15 different foldings of an ALU sequence.

alu.out - Structure output file (120 record length) containing part of the
          output produced by running lrna using bat2.com as input. These 
          are 15 foldings of an ALU sequence. The first is optimal.
          Selected base pairs are marked by   |
                                              ^ .

alu.plot1 - This is an ASCII dot plot file created using
            the plot option in the energy dot plot mode. The run is
            a continuation using the alu.sav file. The energy
            increment selected is 114 ( 11.4 kcal/mole ) which is
            10% of the minimum computed free energy. 4 levels (or
            colors) were selected. The first level is for optimal
            base pairs. Levels 2, 3, and 4 correspond to energy
            increments of 3.8, 7.6, and 11.4 kcal/mole respectively.

alu.plot2 - Similar to alu.plot1. Only three levels (colors) are used 
            up to a total energy increment of 7.6 kcal/mole ( 6.6% 
            from minimum ).

alu.reg - A concatenation of 15 region files containing part of the ouput 
          produced by running lrna using bat2.com as input. These are 15
          foldings of an ALU sequence. The first is optimal.

alu.sav - The unformatted save file created by running lrna using
          bat1.com as input ( lrna  <bat1.com ). This file can be 
          used for a continuation run of lrna (as in : lrna <bat2.com).
          This file is for the folding of an ALU sequence using
          default energy files and no auxiliary information which would
          either force or prohibit specific base pairs.

alu.seq  - Sequence used in sample foldings. Note that A, C, G and U/T
           are in uppercase letters. Bases that are in lowercase
           letters will not be recognized by the program!

alu.gcg - Output of figdot using alu.plot1 and alu.plot2 as input. The
          title is not included in this file. The figure program in the
          Genetics Computer Group package ( GCG ) can be used to transform 
          this device independent plot file into a device specific plot 
          file. The output is two energy dot plots for the folding of the 
          ALU sequence ( produced from lrna using bat1.com & bat2.com ). 
          You could also write your own program to create energy dot plots 
          with labels and using multiple colors for different levels. 

bat1.com - Sample input file for folding an ALU sequence. This 
           input file is the output of the batgen program and produces
           the save file alu1.sav.

bat2.com - Sample input file for folding an ALU sequence. This
           command file is used as input to the lrna program. The
           save file, alu.sav, is read by lrna which then computes
           optimal and suboptimal foldings of an ALU sequence. Up 
           to 200 foldings are allowed, although only 15 are generated. 
           All foldings must be within 10% of the minimum computed free 
           energy and the distance between any pair must be greater than 5.

            file format). Needs jjlib.o at link time.

cvtct.o - Object file for cvtct.

dangle.dat - Energy file for single base stacking (dangling ends) at 37 deg. 
             Entries marked "." should be interpreted as plus infinity.

             to dangle.037 .

dangle.dh - Enthalpy file for single base stacking (dangling ends). 
            This file is used by the newtemp program together with the
            dangle.dat file to produce energy files for folding at
            arbitrary temperatures between 0 and 100 deg. Some single
            base stacking energies may come out positive for high
            temperatures. The program only includes single base

mrna.f - Miscellaneous subroutines for both the linear and circular
         versions of the folding program.

multid.f - This subroutine reads and interprets sequence data. It
           differs from formid in that it automatically returns

            as well as the enthalpy files :

            and computes new energy files for folding at any
            user defined temperature between 0 and 100 degrees.
            The output files are labelled with the appropriate
            temperature. For example, if 25 deg. is selected, the
