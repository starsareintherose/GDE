# Genetic Data Environment

GDE is originally distributed under SunOS in the 1990s by [Eisen](https://doi.org/10.1385/0-89603-358-9:13).

This software is fixed from [Oliveira et al. (2003)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/19.1.153) and re-distributed here.

# Usage

Though the dependency of GDE, xview, is orphaned by quite a lot of distributions, I still fix the software to give an outlook of how biologists worked during the last centenary.

To use it, you must install xview lib and include. xview hardly work well on x86_64 architecture.
